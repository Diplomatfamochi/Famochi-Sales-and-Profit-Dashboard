## 🏛 Business Context & Challenge (Situation)

Famochi is a multi-category retail organization operating across **Office Supplies, Furniture, Technology, and Consumables**.  
Despite having extensive transactional data from **January 2021 onward**, leadership lacked a **single source of truth** for performance monitoring.

### Key Challenges
- Sales and profit data were locked in raw transactional formats  
- Difficulty distinguishing **high-revenue vs high-profit** segments  
- Limited visibility into **customer growth and retention trends**  
- Manual reporting limited strategic and tactical planning  

## 🎯 Objective (Task)

Design and deliver a **KPI-driven BI dashboard** that supports:

- **Tactical decision-making** (monthly performance tracking)  
- **Strategic planning** (quarterly and annual reviews)  

### Primary Stakeholders
- Executive Management  
- Sales Leadership  
- Finance & Operations Teams  

## 🛠 Technical & Analytical Approach (Action)

### 1️⃣ Data Engineering & Governance
- Profiled and cleaned **8,315 transaction records** using Power Query  
- Resolved data type inconsistencies and validated date formats  
- Ensured category and sub-category consistency for reliable segmentation  

### 2️⃣ KPI Framework Design
Before visualization, a business-aligned KPI framework was defined:

- **Total Sales (Revenue):** Overall performance indicator  
- **Total Profit:** Profitability and margin analysis  
- **Total Profit by Year / Month:** Growth and seasonality tracking  
- **Sales by Category & Sub-Category:** Revenue drivers identification  
- **Top 5 Customers by Profit:** Customer value prioritization  
- **Customer Count by Year:** Customer base growth measurement  

### 3️⃣ Data Modeling & Analysis
- Aggregated metrics by **Year, Month, Category, and Customer**  
- Ranked customers by profit contribution  
- Segmented performance to uncover trends and anomalies  

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Dashboard Development
- Designed executive KPI cards for instant performance assessment  
- Built trend visuals (line and bar charts) to highlight seasonality  
- Implemented interactive filters for dynamic drill-down analysis  

## 📈 Strategic Insights & Business Impact (Result)

### Profit Optimization
- Identified product categories with **high sales volume but weaker profit margins**, supporting pricing and margin strategy reviews  

### Customer Intelligence
- Isolated **Top 5 customers** contributing disproportionately to total profit, enabling targeted account management and retention strategies  

### Decision Enablement
- Delivered a **single, automated BI asset**, reducing manual reporting effort and accelerating executive decision-making  

### Scalability
- Created a refreshable dashboard architecture capable of supporting future data growth and expanded analysis
